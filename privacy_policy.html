        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: April 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how your data is handled when you interact with the <strong>Smart Investment Advisor</strong>, an AI-powered investment assistant integrated into our platform and powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 technology.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email, or location. However, your interactions (questions and inputs) may be temporarily processed to generate AI responses. These inputs are not stored or linked to your identity.</p>

        <h2>Use of AI and External Tools</h2>
        <p>The Smart Investment Advisor uses a custom GPT trained with transcripts and PDFs from Charlie Munger’s public interviews and writings. It uses this data to offer long-term investment insights and suggestions based on Munger’s principles.</p>

        <p>The GPT may also use an integrated tool, <strong>Fetch_stock_quote_data_by_stock_ticker</strong>, which retrieves live stock quote data when you ask about specific stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT). No personal information is passed to this tool.</p>

        <h2>Responsibility and Limitations</h2>
        <p>This GPT does not make financial decisions for users. It only provides educational information and possible strategies based on user input. Final decisions rest solely with the user.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>All communication with this GPT is encrypted via HTTPS. Data processed during your session is handled securely and in compliance with OpenAI and AWS data processing standards.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This GPT is hosted and integrated using OpenAI's GPT technology and AWS cloud infrastructure. We adhere to their privacy and data handling policies.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be reflected on this page with the revised effective date.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding this policy or your data, please contact us via the support link provided on the main website.</p>
